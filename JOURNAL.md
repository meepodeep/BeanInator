# 7/20/2025: Made the cad model and outlined the code!

Today I decided to finally start work on this project after having the idea forever. First I did some basic component research, deciding on a 100g load cell from sparkfun, an arduino uno, .96in oled, and 2 servos. After I finished that stage I Made the cad model using fusion360 in 3 hours which was surprisingly quick. Finally, I spent the rest of the day making a software outline, and shipping the project!
