# 7/20/2025: Made the cad model and outlined the code!

Today I decided to finally start work on this project after having the idea forever. First I did some basic component research, deciding on a 100g load cell from sparkfun and an arduino uno. 
Second I Made the cad model, and third I made the final part choices and made a shippable repo!
